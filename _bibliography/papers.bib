  abstract={In edge computing scenarios, there is a need for modeling dedicated features and heterogeneous devices functions, as well as integrating multiple complex scenarios with diverse objectives and frequent interactions. However, existing platforms modeling for the whole device ignores the independence between functional components resulting in limited scenario support. We propose an open-source simulator named EasiEI. EasiEI addresses the need for higher level feature replaceability and independence in modeling complex edge scenarios through independent functional component-level modeling and microkernel architecture. This approach enables users to assemble independent functional components in a plug-and-play manner for heterogeneous devices or different application requirements. EasiEI is fully compatible with all the existing built-in modules in NS3 (a powerful network discrete event simulator). To verify the flexibility and extensibility of EasiEI, we implement several centralized and decentralized computing paradigms cases in a step-by-step way. These cases restore and simulate the performance state of various real devices in real time, meeting the requirements for verifying the edge computing ideas such as task scheduling in a distributed manner. Results show that the simulations have well reflected the characteristics of the real world and can construct complex environment flexibly.},

  publisher={IEEE},
  abstract = {Despite placing services and computing resources at the edge of the network for ultra-low latency, we still face the challenge of centralized scheduling costs, including delays from additional request forwarding and resource selection. To address this challenge, we propose SmartBuoy, a new computing paradigm. Our approach starts with a service coverage concept that assumes users within the coverage have high access availability. To enable users to perceive service status, we design a distributed metric table that synchronizes service status periodically and distributively. We propose coverage indicator updating principles to make the updating process more effective. We then implement two distributed methods, SmartBuoy-Time and SmartBuoy-Reliability, that enable users to perceive service capability directly and immediately. To determine the metric table update window size, we provide an analysis method based on user access patterns and offer a theoretical upper bound in a dynamic environment, making SmartBuoy easy to use. Finally, we implement the proposed methods distributively on an open-source edge computing simulator. Experiments on a real-world network topology dataset demonstrate the efficiency of SmartBuoy in reducing delays and improving the success rate.},

  abstract = {Named data networking (NDN) constructs a network by names, providing a flexible and decentralized way to manage resources within the edge computing continuum. This paper aims to solve the question, “Given a function with its parameters and metadata, how to select the executor in a distributed manner and obtain the result in NDN?” To answer it, we design R2 that involves the following stages. First, we design a name structure including data, function names, and other function parameters. Second, we develop a 2-phase mechanism, where in the first phase, the function request from a client-first reaches the data source and retrieves the metadata. Then the best node is selected while the metadata responds to the client. In the second phase, the chosen node directly retrieves the data, executes the function, and provides the result to the client. Furthermore, we propose a stop condition to intelligently reduce the processing time of the first phase and provide a simple proof and range analysis. Simulations confirm that R2 outperforms the current solutions in terms of resource allocation, especially when the data volume and the function complexity are high. In the experiments, when the data size is 100 KiB and the function complexity is O(n2) , the speedup ratio is 4.61. To further evaluate R2, we also implement a general intermediate data processing logic named “Bolt” implemented on an app-level in ndnSIM. We believe that R2 shall help the researchers and developers to verify their ideas smoothly.},

  title = {REMR: A reliability evaluation method for dynamic edge computing network under time constraints},
  journal = {IEEE Internet of Things Journal},
  volume = {10},
  abstract = {Computation and/or communication-intensive collaborative services accompanied by several distributed tasks/components, such as the services in Internet of Things, can be anywhere nowadays. These services are usually used by users at the Internet edge, making cloud computing struggles with the high end-to-end latency. Thanks to edge computing which pushes resources to the edge, the goals with lower latency can be well satisfied. However, in actual scenarios especially under dynamic edge computing networks, changes exist in resources, including computing, bandwidth, and nodes. Meanwhile, data packets (or flow) among collaborative tasks/components of a service can also not be conserved. These characteristics lead the service reliability hard to be guaranteed and make existing reliability evaluation methods no longer accurate. To study the effect of distributed and collaborative service deployment strategies under such background, we propose a reliability evaluation method (REMR). We first look for the solution set which can meet the time constraints. Then, we calculate the reliability of service supported by the solution set based on the principle of inclusion–exclusion with distributions of available transmission bandwidth and computing resources. Finally, we provide an illustrative example with several real-world data sets to make REMR easy to follow. To make REMR more reliable, we also propose and implement a Monte Carlo simulation method. Experiments prove that the reliability calculated by REMR is nearly the same as the simulation results and both the latencies and the jitters are also at a lower level.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
