  abstract={In edge computing scenarios, there is a need for modeling dedicated features and heterogeneous devices functions, as well as integrating multiple complex scenarios with diverse objectives and frequent interactions. However, existing platforms modeling for the whole device ignores the independence between functional components resulting in limited scenario support. We propose an open-source simulator named EasiEI. EasiEI addresses the need for higher level feature replaceability and independence in modeling complex edge scenarios through independent functional component-level modeling and microkernel architecture. This approach enables users to assemble independent functional components in a plug-and-play manner for heterogeneous devices or different application requirements. EasiEI is fully compatible with all the existing built-in modules in NS3 (a powerful network discrete event simulator). To verify the flexibility and extensibility of EasiEI, we implement several centralized and decentralized computing paradigms cases in a step-by-step way. These cases restore and simulate the performance state of various real devices in real time, meeting the requirements for verifying the edge computing ideas such as task scheduling in a distributed manner. Results show that the simulations have well reflected the characteristics of the real world and can construct complex environment flexibly.},

   abstract = {In the process of modern industrial production, the breakdown of industrial equipment will bring serious economic loss, making the diagnosis of equipment a research hotspot. Among numerous equipment, the dust removal system contains many sub-equipment and parameters, which make its fault diagnosis a challenging problem. This paper introduces a solution to the anomaly detection problem of dust removal fans based on the improved K-means combined with the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model. This study uses K-means to divide the obtained original data into different classes, then utilizes the model to complete the classification and prediction tasks for anomaly detection. It was found that the model used is more suitable for the fault diagnosis of the dust removal fan.},

In this paper, the deep learning network Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network are combined to solve the health problem of the dust removal fan. The deep learning network VAE can map the features of the data to hidden variables, and the LSTM network can extract the time dependence between the data. Experiments show that the VAE-LSTM network is suitable for dust removal fans and has a good effect.},

   abstract = {\textcopyright 2017, \textcopyright The Author(s) 2017. K-means plays an important role in different fields of data mining. However, k-means often becomes sensitive due to its random seeds selecting. Motivated by this, this article proposes an optimized k-means clustering method, named k*-means, along with three optimization principles. First, we propose a hierarchical optimization principle initialized by k* seeds (K*>K) to reduce the risk of random seeds selecting, and then use the proposed “top-n nearest clusters merging” to merge the nearest clusters in each round until the number of clusters reaches at K. Second, we propose an “optimized update principle” that leverages moved points updating incrementally instead of recalculating mean and SSE of cluster in k-means iteration to minimize computation cost. Third, we propose a strategy named “cluster pruning strategy” to improve efficiency of k-means. This strategy omits the farther clusters to shrink the adjustable space in each iteration. Experiments performed on real UCI and synthetic datasets verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
